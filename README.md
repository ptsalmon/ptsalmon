• With TimeBlock, users can upload their schedules, create shared calendars with other users, and compare and contrast their schedules with other TimeBlock users, making it easy to schedule meetings and group events.

• Collaborated with 3 other UF students, employing Agile methodologies such as two-week sprints, scrum, and kanban to successfully deliver in a limited timeframe

• Built frontend with React, Redux, and MaterialUI

• Utilized Firestore for user and calendar data and Firebase Authentication for secure login and authentication

• Created a more accessible gaming experience by transforming a Pygame Super Mario Bros clone into a completely
hands-free system by integrating full voice control with Microsoft Azure Speech SDK speech recognition

• Implemented the following speech controls:

    'down' -> Move menu selection down
    'up' -> Move menu selection up
    'start' -> Start game
    'right' -> Move continuously to the right
    'left' -> Move continuously to the left
    'jump' -> Jump vertically with a slight horizontal movement to the current direction
    'stop' -> Stop
    'fire' -> Throw a fireball

• Gathered 500,000+ data points from top players of the mobile game Clash Royale via API calls with Node.js scripts

• Efficiently stored and analyzed API data using custom Hashmap and Red-Black Tree data structures in C++

• Designed responsive interface using WPF for Visual C++ to help users quickly find successful decks
